Database plan

Tables:
1) Users: uname, passwd(hashed and salted), uid, joined
2) Threads: title, details, user(publisher), views, replies, date-pub,
            isSticky
3) Posts: user(poster), details, images(how? BLOB's?), date-post, quote(how?)

Databases made.
images will be stored seperately, identified by uid's and such.
Inserting them directly into the databases was a bad idea in the first place.

Will add simple bbcode and quoting features next.
Also, need to amp up the style.

Tried to install bbcode(pecl) - failed. Unmainatained package
HTML_BBCodeParser2 is next. No docs avaiable, perusing the php file itself.

HTML_BBCodeParser2 was a success, after locating the git page and downloading the config files
Need to add this to forum.


Mon 11 Dec 2017 12:30:34 AM +0545
BBCode added to forum.


Mon 11 Dec 2017 01:16:46 AM +0545
Fixed textarea formatting(edited class tdetail's style [ white-space: pre-wrap; ])

Removed replies column from threads table;added counting mechanism;

Errors: first line is always indented in posts.
Concerns: relations between tables(simple id's have sufficed for now) - foreign keys?

Hacked bbcode parser to create some terrible code.
Needed to suppot [quote name="xx"] tags in bbcode. Could not do it with HTML2BBCode vanilla.
New format: [bbquote][bbname]xxx[/bbname] fkajf tex this is text [/bbquote]
Also, improved the style a little bit {model: animesuki}
